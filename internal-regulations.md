If there are vacancies on the AC, the AC has a duty to recommend new members to the General Assembly.

## Suspension

If an AC member fails to attend more than three AC meetings in a row, without explaining the reason for not attending, their position will be discussed by the AC. The AC may suspend the AC member in question, by a two-thirds majority vote.

Moreover, the AC can also call a vote to suspend an AC member if that member has become a serious liability to IFLRY's reputation, is suspected of some serious misconduct, or is suspected of fraudulent behaviour. Such a vote can be called for by any AC member and has to be announced to the Bureau and MOs at least two weeks before the AC vote for suspension. The announcement has to include the grounds on which the AC member(s) believe this paragraph to be applicable. For this vote, the member who is proposed to be suspended has no vote, and the vote is carried if and only if no present AC member votes against it, and a majority of AC members' votes cast being in favour (counting present abstentions as votes cast).

A suspension removes an AC member from their position up to and including the next General Assembly. In a case where the suspension still stands, there will be a vote of no confidence against the suspended member organised as per the Rules of Procedure at the next General Assembly.
