Moreover, the AC can also call a vote to suspend an AC member if that member has become a serious liability to IFLRY's reputation, is suspected of some serious misconduct, or is suspected of fraudulent behaviour. Such a vote can be called for by any AC member and has to be announced to the Bureau and MOs at least two weeks before the AC vote for suspension. The announcement has to include the grounds on which the AC member(s) believe this paragraph to be applicable. For this vote, the member who is proposed to be suspended has no vote, and the vote is carried if and only if no present AC member votes against it, and a majority of AC members' votes cast being in favour (counting present abstentions as votes cast).

A suspension removes an AC member from their position up to and including the next GA. In a case where the suspension still stands, there will be a vote of no confidence against the suspended member organised as per the Rules of Procedure at the next General Assembly.
