# General {#gen}

The **General Assembly** (GA) is the highest decision-making body of the Federation. At the beginning of each General Assembly, the draft agenda will be decided on, the minutes of the previous meeting will be put forward for adoption and the relevant officers are proposed for appointment. This part is always chaired by the Bureau. The draft Agenda shall be made available for the membership at least four weeks prior to the General Assembly, by the Bureau or, in the case of an Extraordinary General Assembly, by those who call the meeting.

The Bureau must announce the date, time and location within at least three months before the General Assembly. An invitation for the General Assembly must be circulated eight weeks prior to the General Assembly to the members via e-mail.

## Format

The General Assembly may be held either in-person or online. The General Assembly is expected to meet in-person unless otherwise specified in the Internal Regulations. In the case of an Extraordinary General Assembly, the Bureau shall determine the format.

When a General Assembly is held in person, online participation should be facilitated to the extent possible.

## Languages {#gen-lang}
The General Assembly should use the official languages of the Federation. In the case that no translation facilities are available the working language will be English.

# Membership Rights {#mem-rights}

Voting rights to a General Assembly are stipulated under [article](#ga-voting). Full members have the right to vote, the right to nominate candidates, the right to put forward proposals and the right to submit amendments to all proposals.

Associate members have the right to vote, nominate officers, the right to put forward proposals and the right to submit amendments to all proposals except when it concerns the Manifesto, Statutes, the Rules of Procedure, Internal Regulations or financial documents.

Regional members have the right to put forward resolutions and the right to submit amendments to all proposals except when it concerns the Manifesto, Statutes, the Rules of Procedure, Internal Regulations or financial documents.

Observer members have the right to observe, co-sign political proposals and their amendments and contribute to discussions on political proposals, but no right to vote, nominate candidates or put forward organisational proposals. Observer members are treated as non-voting members and therefore only have the right to observe the proceedings of the Federation and its General Assembly.

The Bureau wields the same rights as Full Members, except for voting rights at the General Assembly and the right to run candidates.

The Individual Members Group has the right to vote, the right to put forward proposals, and the right to submit amendments to all proposals except where it concerns the Manifesto, Statutes, the Rules of Procedure, Internal Regulations or financial documents. For the purpose of defining rights and obligations elsewhere in the Rules of Procedure, individual members are considered to be members, but not member organisations.

# Quorum & Voting {#ga-quorum-voting}
A quorum of 33% of the votes of organisations in good standing shall be required to begin any meeting of a General Assembly.

Decisions are taken by a simple majority of those present and voting, with abstentions being counted as not voting, unless otherwise stated. In the event of a tie vote a recount shall be taken. If there is still a tie vote, the status quo shall persist.

Decisions are only valid where half of the total votes present at the opening of the meeting are cast. Abstentions shall be included for this purpose.

# Authority {#ga-authority}
The General Assembly has the exclusive authority to decide on:

(a) Membership Applications;
(b) Amendments to the Statutes, Rules of Procedure, Internal Regulations and Manifesto;
(c) Expulsion of member organisations.

Depending on the nature of the event, the officers for appointment may be Chairs, Secretaries and Returning Officers.

# Delegations {#ga-delegations}
Voting rights and procedure are stipulated in [article](#ga-voting). Each member organisation shall be responsible for appointing their representatives to meetings of the General Assembly, provided that the representative is a member in good standing of the organisation represented. A member organisation may specify in writing to the Secretary General which of its representatives control voting rights for the organisation. If no representative is specified in writing, any representative present that was nominated by the member organisation shall be entitled to vote on its behalf.

There shall be no limit to the number of delegates from member organisations attending the statutory meeting. Delegates are required to be nominated by their member organisation and other attendees are required to register for attending the statutory meeting. However, the Bureau will only guarantee a full General Assembly arrangement for the number of votes per organisation, unless otherwise stated.

No employee or auditor of the Federation is allowed to hold the voting rights of a member organisation at a statutory meeting.

After the opening of the General Assembly no delegations or members of those delegations nominated to the General Assembly may exercise votes for another delegation. Voting by proxy is not possible.

## Voting Rights and Procedure {#ga-voting}
Voting rights at the General Assembly shall be exercised by full member organisations according to the following scale:

| Number of Members | Votes |
| ----------------- | ----- |
| 1 to 500          |   3   |
| 501 to 1000       |   4   |
| 1001 to 2500      |   5   |
| 2501 to 5000      |   6   |
| 5001 to 10000     |   7   |
| more than 10000   |   8   |

Associate members and the Individual Members Group will receive one vote.

All elections shall take place by secret ballot. All non-election voting shall take place by secret ballot if requested by at least one-third of the votes present.

## Chairs and Returning Officers {#ga-chairs-ros}
The General Assembly shall elect four chairpersons to chair the sessions. The Chairs shall not be running for other elections. The Chairs will also chair the four Standing Committees, unless otherwise agreed by the GA.

The chair shall appoint three returning officers to administer elections and conduct the ballot. The returning officers shall be persons not standing for elections.

The returning officers shall announce the deadline for nominations for auditors.

# Elections {#ga-elections}
For the Bureau elections and appointments to the Advisory Council, those candidacies are valid that were received in writing by the IFLRY office four weeks before the start of the General Assembly.

In elections where multiple rounds of voting are required, successive rounds shall be held immediately.

The incoming Bureau members shall be installed in their roles at the close of the GA.

## President, Secretary General and Treasurer elections {#ga-elections-g3}
The President, the Secretary General and the Treasurer shall be elected by simple majority vote. In the event none of the candidates to each of these positions receives more than 50% of the votes, there will  be additional rounds of voting until the required majority is achieved.

In each of the additional rounds, candidates with the lowest number of votes will be eliminated if they cannot mathematically win even if all votes from candidates with fewer votes were added to their total.

## Vice President Elections {#ga-elections-vp}
The Vice Presidents of the organisation shall be elected using the single transferable vote system (STV), in a way that safeguards the anonymity of votes.

## Auditor Elections {#ga-elections-auditor}
For the election of auditors, the ballot can be filled with one or two names. Each name will count as one vote. It is not possible to give more than one vote to one candidate on each ballot. The two candidates who received the highest number of votes shall be elected auditors. In case of resignation of an auditor, the next person on the last auditor election results list sorted on highest number of votes will replace the vacancy.

## Advisory Council Appointments {#ga-ac-appointment}
Advisory Council members will be appointed by the General Assembly through a simple majority vote.

## Expulsion and Replacement {#ga-elections-expulsion}
It is the right of a General Assembly, both ordinary and extraordinary, to put the mandate of an elected person in question and to terminate that mandate following a motion of no-confidence. A motion of no-confidence requires a two-thirds majority vote to pass, unless it was submitted as an organisational proposal four weeks before the General Assembly, in which case it can pass with a simple majority vote.

Following the expulsion of an elected person it is the right of the General Assembly to immediately elect a replacement. The newly elected Bureau member or auditor will have a period of mandate that expires at the next General Assembly, where, would the mandate of the expelled Bureau member or auditor have originally not been elapsed yet, an election will be held for that position with a term that lasts until the end of the term of the expelled Bureau member or auditor.

# Agenda {#ga-agenda}

Items which propose a change from the status quo. This can include, but is not limited to, organisational motions, the budget proposal, and amendments to the statutory documents. The deadline for submitting organisational proposals is four weeks before the Statutory Meeting or one week after the announcement of an Extraordinary General Assembly, whichever gives the member organisations more time.

## Political Proposals {#ga-political-proposals}
Items which propose a change from the status quo. This can include, but is not limited to, resolutions and amendments to Manifesto.

Manifesto proposals must be submitted four weeks before the General Assembly, and shall be made available to the member organisations no later than one week before the General Assembly.

At the opening of the General Assembly, while adopting the agenda, the membership will vote on the prioritisation of the political proposals that have been submitted. Resolutions will be discussed following the list based on the number of votes, from highest number of votes, to lowest number of votes last.

## Urgency Proposals {#ga-urgency-proposals}
Those resolutions shall be dealt with, which, in the opinion of the General Assembly, could not have been proposed before the official deadline due to their urgent nature. Such resolutions should be submitted to the IFLRY Office before the beginning of the General Assembly, unless a two-thirds majority of those present and voting accept a later resolution as urgent.

## Reports {#ga-reports}
Items which report on the status quo. This includes Bureau reports, annual reports, financial reports and auditor reports. The deadline for submitting reports is two weeks before the Statutory Meeting.

## Amendments {#ga-amendments}
Only proposals may be amended by the statutory event.

Only amendments that are submitted 24 hours prior to the opening of the meeting will be formally discussed, unless otherwise stated.

Secondary amendments can be dealt with on the spot, if the respective Standing Committee agrees by simple majority.

# Standing Committees {#ga-standing-committees}
Standing Committees will meet at each General Assembly and give a recommendation on proposals to the GA. Each Committee shall consist of one delegate from each full and associate member organisation, selected pursuant to each organisation's own procedures. The Bureau shall be represented at each Standing Committee in a non-voting capacity. 

There are four Standing Committees which shall convene at each General Assembly, provided there are issues to discuss: Finances; Membership; Resolutions and Manifesto; and Statutory Documents. The role of the Standing Committees is to deliberate the issues in depth and to deliver a recommendation to the General Assembly.

In each Standing Committee, the member organisations have one vote each, and only one delegate per member organisation may contribute to the discussion and vote of each Standing Committee.
The Bureau shall, and observer members may, be represented at each Standing Committee in a non-voting capacity.

The Bureau shall appoint, subject to confirmation by the General Assembly, a Chair (the congress Chairs, unless otherwise stated) and Secretary for each Standing Committee.

## Standing Committee on Membership {#ga-standing-committee-mem}
The Standing Committee on Membership shall deal with the relevant membership issues prior to their consideration by the GA. This may be membership applications, membership suspensions, membership expulsion, or other relevant issues.

## Standing Committee on Resolutions and Manifesto {#ga-standing-committee-res}
The Standing Committee on Resolutions and Manifesto shall deal with amendments to the Manifesto as well as Resolutions and Urgency Resolutions, prior to their consideration by the GA. In addition, the Committee shall on an ongoing basis provide a process for reviewing and if necessary, amending the Manifesto.

The Chairs may decide upon a deadline for secondary amendments to the political proposals. Resolutions, urgency resolutions and amendments to those political proposals will be accepted by a simple majority. Amendments to the Manifesto will be adopted if accepted by a two-thirds majority of those present and voting.

In the situation where the Standing Committee is not able to discuss all resolutions, they will discuss as many as possible following the order of the prioritised list, as decided by the GA.

In voting on amendments, the chair shall normally first hold a vote on the amendment furthest removed in substance from the original motion, then on the amendment next furthest and so on until all amendments have been voted on or one has been accepted.

The proposer of a resolution may withdraw the resolution at any time before the vote takes place.

## Standing Committee on Statutory Documents {#ga-standing-committee-rop}
The Standing Committee on Statutory Documents shall review any proposed amendments to the Statutes, Rules of Procedure, and Internal Regulations prior to their consideration by the GA.
