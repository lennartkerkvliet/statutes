# General

## Name
The association is established under Belgian law with the name "International Federation of Liberal Youth, Association Internationale Sans But Lucratif (AISBL)". This is abbreviated as IFLRY.

## Place
The registered office of the association is located in the Brussels-Capital Region of Belgium. 

## Aim {#aim}
IFLRY is a federation of youth organisations and young individuals with the collective aim of promoting freedom and advocating for political liberalism around the globe. IFLRY commits itself to the active advancement of human rights, democracy, stable property rights, rule of law, and free trade. IFLRY provides political education and acts as a platform for networking and exchanging ideas. These aims shall be advanced through publications, seminars, policy recommendations, exchanges, symposia, courses, and statutory events. IFLRY further strives to facilitate democratic inclusion, local and international activism, and cooperation between its member organisations.

## Language 
The official languages of the organisation are French, Spanish and English. The working language of the association is English and is used for all official documents apart from the statutes, for which the French version is binding as required by Belgian law. 

## Documents {#docs}
The statutory governing documents of the association are, in order of precedence: 

* **Statutes**, 
* **Rules of Procedure**, 
* **Internal Regulations**. 

The Statutes provide a broad overview of the structure and purpose of the association. The Rules of Procedure set out the organisational procedures including meetings, voting and decision making processes of the association. The Internal Regulations govern the behaviours, rights and responsibilities of members. Where the statutory documents cannot be applied, the General Assembly decides.

<!-- **Membership Fee Statute** -->

# Affiliations 

## Liberal International
IFLRY is a full member of the Liberal International and holds a special status as its officially recognised international liberal youth organisation. In this capacity, IFLRY collaborates closely with Liberal International to promote shared values, while retaining complete autonomy and independence in its decision-making, governance, and activities.

# Structure 

IFLRY operates on a federal structure and is primarily composed of member organisations. The highest decision-making body of the association is the **General Assembly** (see [article](#ga)), comprising representatives from its members. The General Assembly is responsible for setting the overall direction of the association and adopting key decisions.

Daily management and external representation are handled by an elected executive **Bureau** (see [article](#bureau)), which operates in accordance with the statutes and decisions of the General Assembly. The work of the Bureau is overseen by an **Advisory Council** (see [article](#ac)), which provides guidance and ensures that the Bureau adheres to the policies and strategic direction set by the General Assembly.

The General Assembly, Bureau, and Advisory Council are the three statutory bodies that collectively govern the association in compliance with Belgian law. The association may employ staff, collectively referred to as the **Office**, to handle administrative and operational tasks (see [article](#office)). The Office operates under the direction of the Bureau.

# Voting Thresholds {#voting-methods}

IFLRY has the following voting methods:

* **simple majority:** requires a greater number of votes in favour than against;
* **absolute majority:** requires a greater number of votes in favour than the combined number of votes abstaining and against;
* **simple two-thirds majority:** requires a greater number of votes in favour than twice the number against;
* **absolute two-thirds majority:** requires a greater number of votes in favour than twice the combined number of votes abstaining and against. 

Unless specified otherwise, all decisions made by the bodies defined in these statutes shall be made by simple majority.

Abstaining from voting is always allowed. Both actively abstaining, where the abstention is specifically communicated, as well as passive abstensions, where a voting member of a body is counted as present but refrains from voting, are treated identically.

# Membership

## Composition
IFLRY is composed of five types of member organisations: 

* **Full Members** 
* **Associate Members** 
* **Observer Members** 
* **The Individual Members Group** 
* **Regional Members** 

## Membership Admission
All national youth or national student organisations in agreement with the aims of IFLRY (as described in [article](#aim)) and the **Manifesto** are welcome to apply for full or associate membership status. Similarly, international youth organisations representing a coherent region of the world and satisfying the same requirements are welcome to apply for regional membership status. Organisations that do not fit these criteria may instead apply for observer membership.

The Individual Members Group (IMG) is a distinct entity which collectively holds membership in its own right. Admission to the IMG is granted by an **Individual Members Vetting Committee** (IMVC) appointed by the Bureau.

Full membership can be granted by an absolute two-thirds majority of Full Members present at the General Assembly. Regional membership can be granted by an absolute two-thirds majority vote of the General Assembly. Associate membership can be granted by an absolute majority vote of the General Assembly. Observer membership can be granted by a simple majority vote of the General Assembly. 

<!-- ## TODO: add Voting Rights of Members -->

## Membership Obligations {#mem-obligations} 
All members commit themselves to fulfilling both of the following membership obligations:

(a) to adhere to the financial obligations as stated in the Membership Fee Statute. Organisations and individual members which have fulfilled these obligations are considered in good financial standing;
(b) to uphold the values as stated in the Manifesto.
<!-- GET RID OF: (c) to support the work being done by the statutory bodies of the Federation. -->

## Membership Suspension, Termination and Modification 
Member organisations can be temporarily suspended, or have their membership terminated, for breaches of membership obligations as described in [article](#mem-obligations) or other severe reasons. The voting procedure used for suspending or expelling an organisation is the same as would be used for admiting any other organisation of an equivalent membership type.
